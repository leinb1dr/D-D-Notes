## Description

This magical amulet is crafted from a smooth, polished piece of shell and is decorated with intricate carvings of various animals and plants. When worn by the Tortle Druid, the amulet imbues them with an aura of friendship and camaraderie. 

## Affect

Whenever the Tortle Druid is within 15 feet of a friendly creature, both the Tortle Druid and that creature gain a +2 bonus to their friendly Charisma checks (i.e. persuasion, a white lie, intmidating motivation) and all saving throws. 

In addition, once per day, the Tortle Druid can use the amulet to cast the spell "Animal Friendship" without expending a spell slot. This effect lasts for 1 hour and affects any non-hostile animal within 30 feet of the Tortle Druid.
