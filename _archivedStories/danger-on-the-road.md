### 1: Ambush From Below
> The caravan has been working its way north to fishmill to drop exchange goods. It has four passengers that have been picked up along the way. The guards for the caravan have been getting more tense the closer the caravan gets to Fishmill, as they were ambushed by Goblins the last time they came through. They were able to fight them off, but two guards died last time and they are worried that there will be more this time around.
> The lead caravan calls for a halt and the guards move up to see what is going on.
	
Logs Blocking the Road: 60 ft up ahead there are two tree trunks blocking the road. DC 12 Wisdom(Perception) check to notice the logs are chopped down, not uprooted. This is apparent once they get within 30 ft.

Attack:
> Once the logs begin to be moved and are shifted, the ground begins to shake and dirt erupts from the last caravan. An Ankheg erupts from the ground, taking one of the horses from the cart. The other two carts are spooked and take off. The solders follow the cart in a defensive posture. 
> Once it gets the horse or is attacked it will leave.

### 2: Arrival in South Fishmill
>The arrival to Fishmill is not as the group expected, after being ambushed by the large insect like creature. After exiting the forest line the party sees what appears to be a series of houses that have been abandoned and overgrown, there is a lumber mill by the river that seems well maintained and a pier for a fairy.
	
**Fairy:** The fairy was pulled across the river and is currently tied off on the other side.

**Abandoned houses:** A search of the houses shows they have not been occupied in many years and some are only supported by the trees that grow through them.

**Lumber Mill:** A large mill, that looks as though work was stopped in the middle of milling some boards, tools are left scattered around without being put away.

### 3: Arrival in Fishmill
	After crossing the river into Fishmill, it is feels like a frontier town. There are 3 buildings that make up the center of the town. An inn, a medium sized meeting hall, and a home. There are tents set up and the guards from the caravan are getting settled in. There is a small residence on the water just on the edge of town and the farms can be seen to the north. To the east is a water mill and several building father down by the coast.
	
**The Lonely Stag:** Inside the lonely stag the merchants are the center of several patrons redescribing the events from the road.

## Part 2: Hunt a Beast

### 1: Tracking the creature
>Arriving back at the site of the attack the ground is torn up all around the carts. The remaining car is half buried in dirt as it seems to have fallen into one of the tunnels. There are two wolves that are picking through some of the crates, eating salted meats that were left behind.
	
**Wolves:**
>There are three wolves. Two interacting with the crates and three hiding in the woods. The wolves will see the party approaching, but not be interested in them. If the part attacks the wolves, the three wolves comes from the side to join the attack. If they scare off the wolves using a loud noise the Angkeg will attack.
* 5 Wolves (250xp)  (375/1800)
* 1 Ankheg leaves after taking damage

**Goblin Camp:**
>When searching the area, they will find the remains of a goblin camp about a week old. There are 20cp scattered among the bodies and the ground is torn up all around. DC 10 Wisdom(Perception) to notice the goblin before they are right under him.
	
**Lits (Hidden Goblin):**
>A goblin crouching on a branch in the tree. He is visible as the branch he is standing on is quivering with his fear. The goblin looks a little bloody, but mostly exhausted. The camp looks like it has been abandoned a week and this goblin may have been up there the whole time. He has an arrow nocked, but hasn't fired.

>He knows roughly the direction the creature has gone, and knows the traps set in the area. He will agree to help them if they help him bury his family, as it killed the remaining members of his family.

## 2: Finding the Lair
>The forest was humble, spacious, and flourishing. Its canopy was demanded by poplar, walnut, and redwood, who left just enough light for all sorts of herbs to cultivate the insect riddled soils below. A mixture of animal sounds, which were caused by fleeing animals, brightened up the forest. As you travel you find collapsed tunnels, the tell tale sign of the Ankheg.
	
**Traps:**

	If Lits is with them, they navigate the forest and by pass two traps
	4 Successes 	 1 trap with advantage
	3 Success	 1 trap

### 3: Ankheg Nest
>After travelling for a few hours and dealing with the goblin traps, the collapsed burrowing tunnels seem to lead to a cave opening. All around the cave trees and the forest floor is torn up. All of the tunnels lead to a cave enterence. Some light pours in, however the cave seems dark.
>The cave is dark and dry. The cave seems to have several levels. The cave floor is crisscrossed with Ankheg burrows, however most of them seem to originate from the upper left of the cave.

	There are 4 eggs in a kind of nest/fissure. There are the remains of several egg shells.
