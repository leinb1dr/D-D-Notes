## Description
Fishmill is a coastal town that was abandoned for an unknown reason hundreds of years ago. It was recently reestablished after a scouting group found the area to be plentiful in fish and forestry as well as ample farmland.

Over the past year a fishery has been built with a few fisherman, several farms have been established and a wood mill is planned.

The mystery of why this land was abandoned still hangs over the town, but the current residents are doing just fine.

## Details
Race Relations
The area is re-established by humans.
There weren't any other races in the area, but several have moved into town.
Everyone is looking for a fresh start so most are accepting of people.

## Ruler Status
In the early days of the town's establishment a Firbolg moved to town and her strong will and leadership lead most of the town to looking to her as a defacto leader. There has never been any official vote to give her authority most people simply defer to her. As such, other individuals with a few followers tend to challenge her as to why she is making decisions.

## Notable Traits
The area was abandoned over a hundred years ago and no one knows why. Researchers have travelled through trying to unearth some history, but have never found anything. Now the new town has a mystique.

## Known For
The town's tavern that is run by the Firbolg, has a Firbolg ale designed for the half giant's weight.
