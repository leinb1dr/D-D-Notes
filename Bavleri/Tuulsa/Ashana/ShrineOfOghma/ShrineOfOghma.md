The temple to Oghma in Ashana is a tall, three-story building made of white stone. The fa√ßade is adorned with intricate carvings of books, quills, and scrolls, and the entrance is marked by a large oak door with silver hinges. 

The main hall is a grandiose chamber with a vaulted ceiling supported by marble columns, and it is filled with the smell of incense and the sound of prayers being whispered. The walls are lined with shelves upon shelves of books, and in the center of the hall, there is a massive oak table with a large book chained to it, the holy scripture of Oghma. 

The inner sanctum, accessible only to the most devoted worshippers, houses a rare collection of magical tomes and artifacts, guarded by acolytes who have taken a vow of silence.
