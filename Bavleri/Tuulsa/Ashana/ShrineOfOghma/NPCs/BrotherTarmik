## Appearance

Brother Tarmik is a tall, lean man with short brown hair and piercing blue eyes. He wears simple yet elegant robes of blue and silver, adorned with the symbol of Oghma on the chest. He carries a staff, which he uses both as a walking stick and a symbol of his clerical office.

## Personality

Brother Tarmik is a kind and generous man, who believes in the power of knowledge and education to improve people's lives. He is a staunch advocate of the importance of libraries and spends much of his time collecting rare books and manuscripts to add to his collection. He is also deeply committed to helping the poor and downtrodden, and spends a considerable portion of his wealth on charitable causes.

## Background

Brother Tarmik grew up in a wealthy family but was never satisfied with a life of idle luxury. He found his calling as a cleric of Oghma, the god of knowledge and inspiration, and dedicated himself to the pursuit of knowledge and helping others. He spends most of his time traveling the land, visiting libraries and collecting rare tomes, which he donates to libraries in impoverished areas. He also uses his wealth to fund education initiatives, such as scholarships for underprivileged students and the construction of new schools.
