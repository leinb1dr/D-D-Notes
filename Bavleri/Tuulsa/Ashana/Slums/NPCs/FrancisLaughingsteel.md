Background: Francis used to be a successful merchant, but after he refused to pay a bribe to a corrupt official, his business was ruined and he was exiled from the city. He has been living in the old quarter ever since and has become a vocal opponent of the city's corrupt regime. He joined the resistance shortly after it was formed and has been helping them in any way he can.
