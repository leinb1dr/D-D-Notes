The old quarter is a sprawling district of ruined buildings and collapsed walls, with vegetation growing wild among the debris.

The exiled Vagrants live in makeshift shelters constructed from scavenged materials, and huddle around fires for warmth and light.

The narrow streets are unlit and full of debris, with the occasional rusted metal or rotting wood door marking an entrance to an abandoned building.
