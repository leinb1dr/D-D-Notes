### Description
A man in his mid thirties with a charming smile, Fenton is a charismatic bard who performs at the Calm Peanut tavern. He is often seen with his lute, playing cheerful tunes for the patrons.

### Background
Fenton grew up in a small village on the outskirts of a bustling city. His parents were both bards, and they encouraged his love of music and storytelling from a young age. As he grew older, Fenton became fascinated with the world beyond his small town, and set out on a journey of discovery that has taken him to many different places. Along the way, he has honed his skills as a bard, and is always looking for new stories to tell and new songs to sing.
